Two things are required in order to connect openhab2 to myopenhab.org using openhab Cloud Connector.

Ref: http://docs.openhab.org/addons/io/openhabcloud/readme.html

### UUID  
File path: `/var/lib/openhab2/uuid`

### secret  
File path: `/var/lib/openhab2/openhabcloud/secret`

### Troubleshooting
If myopenhab.org is not working, it could be related to an old JAVA version, see [RPi - update JAVA via apt repo](https://github.com/dernorberto/openhab/blob/master/openhab2-issuesnfixes.md)
